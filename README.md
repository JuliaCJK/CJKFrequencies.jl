A Julia package that provides some convenience functions for working with character/term frequencies of CJK language corpora (currently only implemented for specific Chinese frequency datasets).

See the [documentation](https://tmthyln.github.io/CJKFrequencies.jl/latest/) for more details. Note that while this code is MIT-licensed, certain character frequency datasets are not (more details in the docs).
