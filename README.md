A Julia package that provides some convenience functions for working with character/term frequencies of CJK language corpora (currently only implemented for specific Chinese frequency datasets, but see the docs for how to add more).

See the [documentation](https://JuliaCJK.github.io/CJKFrequencies.jl/latest/) for more details.
